        <h1>creations in life</h1>
       <p>The creation of the earth <br>and all that is within the earth is mysterious,<br> yet miraculous at the same time.  Although there are probably hundreds of different accounts, they all seem to be <br>different while almost identical in text. I will be comparing and contrasting between the Priestly account and the Yahwist account in the book of Genesis.<br> Along with these accounts I will be discussing the key elements in the theology of creation <br>and eco-spirituality in the world and the way they fit into my life. These two versions of creation can be distinguished in various ways.  The two stories differed in how they were told, how humans were created, a human's purpose in life,<br> and the image and role that God played. These two accounts are very different when it comes to the creation of life and the role that God played; however, they compare when it comes to the purpose of a human beings life.  These two accounts<br> are considered very different but they are similar in the <br><br>
        following manner.
